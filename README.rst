# pheno.plugin
Phenotype plugin for Protege 5

## Goals of the plugin

I want to automate some of the steps that I am doing over and over again via mouse click:
* Always need to separately enter information such as (1) label (2) definition (3) comment (4) citations/PMID. It would be easier to have this in one tab
* Often need to format (remove whitespace or invalid characters
* Spell check (?)
* Check that no other terms have the same or similar labels (show a list of the terms with the most similar labels).
* Add synonyms
* Add layperson synonym with all of the correct annotations

## Creating the plugin

Protege plugin creation is not extremely well documented, and so I am recording my steps here in order to
be able to reconstruct mistakes precisely. Let's see how far we get...


## Steps (development)

1. Currently, I have copied the examples from the protege website. TODO: more.
